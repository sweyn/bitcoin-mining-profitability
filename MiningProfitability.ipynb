    "------------\n",
    "As outlined in Satoshi's whitepaper [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System], a network of timestamp servers secures the Bitcoin blockchain by calculating a hash for each block header. A healthy Biticoin \"minining\" sector is necessary for the future of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies which use \"proof of work\" to safeguard distributed ledgers against double spending. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this analysis is to construct a Bitcoin mining profitability model which can help prospective or exisiting Bitcoin miners plan capacity. By removing some of the uncertainty from miners' investment decisions, we hope to lower risk of investment, encourage comptetition and drive Bitcoin mining towards becoming a reliable and reputable utility underpinning a healthy cryptocurrency ecosystem. \n",

    "The Bitcoin Mining Profit Function\n",
    "---------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by constructing a profit function for a single miner:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Profit = Revenues - OpEx - CapEx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Revenues\n",
    "\n",
    "Revenues are proportional to share of mining network. Let's call the initial network hashrate $h_{0}$ and the additional planned capacity $X$, both measured in Petahash. Then revenues generated by the added capacity are\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Revenues =  \\frac{X}{h_{0}+X} \\times B \\times (S + F) \\times UTZ $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $B$ is Bitcoin price in \\$/BTC, $S$ is the new supply and $F$ are the transfer fees over any given period. UTZ is a dimensionless factor less than one representing capacity utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity we assume $h_{0}$ changes slowly while capacity $X$ is being added, $h_{0}$ is effectively static. In reality, $h_{0}$ may change, new miners may enter while $X$ is being deployed, existing miners may also shut scale back as new capacity erodes their margins. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Operating expenes\n",
    "\n",
    "Operating expenes are proportional to the added capacity $X$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ OpEx = C \\times X $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The factor $C$ has units of \\$/Petahash and depends on mining system power consumption $POW$, the co-location Power Usage Efficiency $PUE$ and the co-location price $CLC$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C = CLC \\times PUE \\times POW $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $CLC$ is measured in \\$/W, $PUE$ is a dimensionless factor greater than one, and $POW$ is the system efficiency in W/Petahash. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Capital expenses\n",
    "\n",
    "Capital expenses are amortised over time $T$ and have a variable component $X/z$ which scales with capacity deployed and a fixed component, $NRE$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ CapEx = \\frac{1}{T}\\times\\left(\\frac{X}{z} + NRE \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $1/z$ is the capital cost of additional capacity, measured in \\$/Petahash, and $NRE$ denotes the fixed cost of system developement in \\$, often referred to as Non-Recurring Engineering costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The profit function\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting together the terms for revenues, opex and capex, we construct a Bitcoin profit function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi(X) = \\frac{X}{h_{0}+X} \\times B \\times (S + F) - X \\times C - \\frac{1}{T}\\times\\left(\\frac{X}{z} + NRE \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "A plot of the terms of the profit function shows how incremental revenue declines with with added capacity, the revenue function is concave in $X$. Capital costs and operational costs, however, are linear in $X$. Mining is profitable when revenues exceed costs, the shaded area marks the profitable range for $X$. (For convenience, we set $$UTZ = 1$$ but introduce it later in the reference calculation.)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Profit function](plots/economics-notebook.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because revenues are concave and costs linear, the profit function can have two break even points, $h_{BE}^{Lower}$ and $h_{BE}^{Upper}$. Between the breakeven points lies the point of maximum profitabilty $h_{*}$. If too much capacity is added incremental revenues ultimately become lower than incremental operating expenditure, this occurs at the maximum hashrate $h_{CAP}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Maximum hashrate\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h_{CAP} = \\frac{ B (S + F) }{C} $$\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Hashrate of maximum profitability\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h^{*} = \\sqrt{\\frac{h_{0} B (S + F)}{C+\\frac{1}{zT}}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Breakeven hashrates \n",
    "\n",
    " $$ h_{BE}^{Upper/Lower} = h_{0} + \\frac{B(S+F) - h_{0} ( C +\\frac{1}{zT}) - \\frac{NRE}{T}}{2(C +\\frac{1}{zT})} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{( B(S+F) - h_{0} ( C +\\frac{1}{zT}) - \\frac{NRE}{T} )^2 - 4(C +\\frac{1}{zT}) h_{0} \\frac{NRE}{T} }}{2(C +\\frac{1}{zT})} $$\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Shortest payback\n",
    " \n",
    "The root of $$B(S+F) - h_{0} ( C +\\frac{1}{zT}) - \\frac{NRE}{T} )^2 - 4(C +\\frac{1}{zT}) h_{0} \\frac{NRE}{T} =0$$ which represents the larger value of $T$ is the shortest possible payback period, $T_{Implied}$.\n",
